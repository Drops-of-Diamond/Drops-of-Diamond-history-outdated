# James' high-level goals
- [x] [Learn Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).  (I know C++ (going about halfway through learncpp.com) and Python (e.g. Learn Python the Hard Way and https://docs.python.org).)
- [x] Read through https://github.com/ethereum/sharding.
- [ ] Continue familiarising with the [Python sharding implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding) and [eWASM](https://github.com/ewasm/evm2wasm). 
- [ ] Start building an implementation in Javascript, forked [here](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/evm2wasm) from [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ewasm/evm2wasm).
- [ ] Raise funds when an MVP is built.
- [ ] Continue building and probably hire other devs.

Work at least ~~three days a week~~ full-time on this (not spending any more time on reading research docs), ~~while continuing to work two days a week at Sungrow. However, if I receive regular remuneration or donations for this work (you can send donations personally to me at jamesray.eth. A separate multisig account may be set up if other devs commit to the work.) then I will be more inclined to give up the job at Sungrow.~~

Update 2: drop this project and work on a sharding implementation for eWASM, or finish building eWASM. https://gitter.im/Drops-of-Diamond/Lobby?at=5a7abc54f283b8e5462dda48
