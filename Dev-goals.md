# James' high-level goals
1. Done: ~~[Learn Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).~~  (I know C++ (going about halfway through learncpp.com) and Python (e.g. Learn Python the Hard Way and https://docs.python.org).)
2. Continue familiarising with the [Python sharding implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding) and [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm). Done: read through https://github.com/ethereum/sharding/tree/develop/sharding.
3. Start building an implementation in Javascript, forked [here](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/ethereumjs-vm) from [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm).
4. Raise funds when an MVP is built.
5. Continue building and probably hire other devs.

Work at least ~~three days a week~~ full-time on this (not spending any more time on reading research docs), ~~while continuing to work two days a week at Sungrow. However, if I receive regular remuneration or donations for this work (you can send donations personally to me at jamesray.eth. A separate multisig account may be set up if other devs commit to the work.) then I will be more inclined to give up the job at Sungrow.~~
