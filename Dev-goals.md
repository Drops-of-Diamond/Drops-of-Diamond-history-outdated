# James' high-level goals
1. [Learn Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide). I know C++ (going about halfway through learncpp.com) and Python (e.g. Learn Python the Hard Way and https://docs.python.org). 
2. Continue familiarising with the [Python sharding implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding). I've read the readme and some code already.
3. Start building an implementation in Javascript.

Work at least three days a week on this (not spending any more time on reading research docs), while continuing to work two days a week at Sungrow. However, if I receive regular remuneration or donations for this work (you can send donations personally to me at jamesray.eth. A separate multisig account may be set up if other devs commit to the work.) then I will be more inclined to give up the job at Sungrow.
